Today I went back to Coffeescripting. I am working on the same project as I did a couple days last week and quite a bit during my apprenticeship. However, today I paired with my mentor, which I have done quite a bit throughout my apprenticeship. 

There have been a couple times on the project where we have had to use dates to determine how a users' request is handled. For example, if a user didn't fill in a required field on a, say, a profile for a website within a set period of time after signing up. You might want to have to redirect them to a page to force them to complete this field before continuing using the website. For the most part, this took up a good portion of the day. We were using date objects and adjusting dates for the future.  

Another thing that my pair and I did today was upgrade a dependency that we were using. Software always changes, and when your dependencies change, you're going to have to change the code that uses these dependencies. Depending on how big of a change the new version of your dependency, there will be many areas of your code might break. You're going to have to take these things into consideration on whether you want to update your dependencies or not. 

These were just a couple things that I picked up on from todays pairing session. Tomorrow I look forward to working on a new project that deals with mobile development and Android! Stay tuned.
